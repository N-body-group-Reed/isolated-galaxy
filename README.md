# isolated-galaxy
This repository is the home for work starting in summer 2018 concerning the development of an isolated bar galaxy.

**Goals**
* Develop an isolated bar galaxy using pyICs (https://github.com/jakobherpich/pyICs), run it using changa (https://github.com/N-BodyShop/changa), and visualize it using pynbody (https://github.com/pynbody/pynbody)
* Test more complex theories on specific bar galaxy examples.
