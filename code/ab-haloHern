# 2019-05-01: aa-haloHern stopped producing data after 5 minutes -- according to my new monitor progress idea
# The new idea is to constantly watch the dot-o ... file.  This plan seems to work nicely.
# aa-haloHern choked at a domain decomposition

sim = EquilibriumHalo(fname = "ab-haloHern.out", n_particles = 20e4, f_bary = 0.01, spin_parameter = 0.3)
#
# spin_parameter at 0.3 was good for r-haloHern.
# Trying to reproduce the t-haloHern results.  aa-haloHern ONLY had n_particles to 1e3.
# Perhaps there is a detailed and technical reason for number of particles and number of nodes
#
sim.make_halo()
sim.finalize()
#
# The run time for these ICs, for 100 steps was 2 hrs. for 4 nodes, 96 processors.
#
# Getting a taste of scaling for the code document for a Res. Alloc.
