# 2019-04-03: r-haloHern was the longest run
# Goal now is to see how the pyICs parameter f_bary effects the early images. 
# Lowering the spin parameter and increasing ddelta -- in q-haloHere was a disaster

# spin_parameter at 0.3 was good for r-haloHern but r-haloHern.201 had a spin_parameter that was much lower
# for r-haloHern i will set ddelta to 0.007 and the number of steps to 400
# for s-haloHern i will keep the ddelta of 0.007, but decrease the number of steps
