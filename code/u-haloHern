# 2019-04-08: t-haloHern tested making ang. mom. profile, mu, five times the standard value
# The results didn't show an effect on disk sub-structure
# Goal now is to see how integration time will affect the faceon disk -- a la Jakob H.

# spin_parameter at 0.3 was good for r-haloHern 
# for s-haloHern was set ddelta to 0.007 and the number of steps to 100
# for t-haloHern i will keep the ddelta of 0.007, but decrease the number of steps to 100
# for u-haloHern i will increase ddelta a bit and run for at least 3 Gyr
# for u-haloHern i increased n_particles by an order of magnitude
